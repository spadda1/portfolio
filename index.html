                <p>
                    I worked as an IT Support Specialist at Nimblesoft LLC from August 2021 to May 2024, 
                    where I ensured the smooth operation of the company’s IT infrastructure through technical support, 
                    system maintenance, user training, and proactive management of network security and user accounts. 
                    During this time, I completed my Associate of Science for Transfer degree in Computer Science at Sierra College, 
                    graduating with high academic honors in May 2024. 
                    During the summer of 2024, I completed a 7 week software engineering fellowship at Headstaer AI.
                    During my fellowship as a Software Engineer at Headstarter AI, I gained practical experience in developing innovative 
                    AI and machine learning solutions, collaborating with a skilled team to enhance application functionality while 
                    refining my software engineering and problem-solving skills.
                    In Fall 2024, I transferred to the University of California, Davis, 
                    to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I plan to join clubs such as the Google Developer 
                    Student Club to enhance my coding skills through projects and research opportunities, as well as CodeLab, which focuses 
                    on software development and UX design, providing hands-on experience with real companies. I aim to secure a software engineering 
                    internship for summer 2025, prior to completing my Bachelor's degree in June 2026, after which I intend to pursue a Master's degree 
                    in Computer Science while working part-time as a software engineer.

                                During my fellowship as a Software Engineer at Headstarter AI, I gained valuable experience in creating 
                                innovative solutions that harnessed artificial intelligence and machine learning. I collaborated with a 
                                skilled team to design and refine applications that addressed real-world problems. My duties encompassed the 
                                development of code across various programming languages, participation in code review processes, and the 
                                implementation of optimal methodologies within software development. Furthermore, I assumed a pivotal role in 
                                integrating AI algorithms into our products, augmenting their functionality and performance. This opportunity 
                                not only broadened my understanding of software engineering principles but also sharpened my problem-solving 
                                abilities and my capacity to work effectively in an agile environment. Ultimately, my experience at Headstarter 
                                AI was instrumental in shaping my career and igniting my passion for leveraging technology to create meaningful 
                                change.

                                LAW GPT serves as a legal assistant powered by AI intended to provide legal knowledge to all. 
                                It makes use of natural language processing (NLP) technologies and is developed using programming languages such as 
                                Python and JavaScript for backend and frontend development. The platform integrates frameworks and libraries like TensorFlow 
                                and Flask for machine learning and web application development, respectively. Additionally, it employs cloud services, such as 
                                Firebase for user authentication and data storage, ensuring secure and scalable operations. Law GPT streamlines the legal assistance 
                                process by integrating advanced AI algorithms with an easy-to-use interface, enabling legal inquiries, document reviews, and case management.

                            <p>The Inventory Tracker is a web application built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation, 
                                and utilizes Firebase for backend services. It features Firestore for real-time database functionality, allowing users to manage their 
                                inventory by adding, removing, and searching for items seamlessly. The application employs Material-UI for responsive design components, 
                                ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface. TypeScript enhances the development process with type safety, while custom CSS resets 
                                improve cross-browser styling consistency. Additionally, the use of environment variables secures sensitive Firebase configuration details, 
                                making the application both robust and secure.

                            <h5>Animated Book Landing Page</h5>
                            <p>
                                The animated book website landing page is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the Materialize CSS framework 
                                for responsive design and visual appeal. Font Awesome icons enhance navigation and user interaction, while a structured layout 
                                features a header with a logo and navigation links, a dynamic carousel showcasing book covers, and detailed content sections for each title. 
                                The JavaScript functionality includes a search feature for filtering book information in real-time and interactive background changes upon 
                                carousel item selection. The website employs jQuery for smooth carousel transitions and utilizes external resources like CDN links for quick 
                                loading and consistent styling. Overall, this combination of technologies creates an engaging, user-friendly experience for book enthusiasts.
